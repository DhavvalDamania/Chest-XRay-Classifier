# Chest-XRay-Classifier
🫁 Chest X-Ray Classification – LungVision Dataset

📌 Overview
This project uses MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network, to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. It leverages the LungVision Dataset to build a deep learning model that can assist in early screening and triage.

About the Dataset - The lung images dataset is a comprehensive collection of images used for the training and evaluation of deep-learning models for the diagnosis of lung infections. The dataset contains a total of 17,275 images, consisting of 10,406 normal images, 5,775 pneumonia images, and 1,094 tuberculosis infected images. The images were sourced from multiple locations, including RSNA, Montgomery County chest X-ray set, Shenzhen chest X-ray, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, and their collaborators.
